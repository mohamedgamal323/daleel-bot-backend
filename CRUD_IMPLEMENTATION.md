# Full CRUD Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Soft Delete, Restore) operations for all entities (Domain, Category, Asset, User) in the FastAPI backend with soft delete support.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Soft Delete Support
- All entities now have `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` timestamps
- Implemented `soft_delete()`, `restore()`, `is_deleted()`, and `update()` methods on all entities
- No hard deletes are performed - all deletes are soft deletes

### 2. Repository Layer Updates
- Extended all repository interfaces to support:
  - `get()` with `include_deleted` parameter
  - `list()` with `include_deleted` parameter
  - `update()` method
  - `soft_delete()` method
  - `restore()` method
- Updated memory repository implementations with full CRUD support

### 3. Service Layer Updates
- Extended all services (UserService, DomainService, CategoryService, AssetService) with:
  - Create operations with validation (duplicate checking)
  - Read operations with soft delete filtering
  - Update operations with validation
  - Soft delete operations
  - Restore operations
- Added comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### 4. API Controllers Updates
- **V1 Controllers**: Updated all endpoints with full CRUD operations
- **Admin Controllers**: Updated all endpoints with full CRUD operations + admin defaults (include_deleted=true)
- Implemented proper request/response models using Pydantic
- Added query parameters for filtering (domain_id, category_id, include_deleted)

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- Created extensive test suites for all services
- Tests cover all CRUD operations, soft delete/restore, validation, and error handling
- All tests are passing (29 total tests)

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Users (`/api/v1/users`)
- `POST /` - Create user
- `GET /` - List users (with optional include_deleted)
- `GET /{user_id}` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /{user_id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /{user_id}` - Soft delete user
- `POST /{user_id}/restore` - Restore user

### Domains (`/api/v1/domains`)
- `POST /` - Create domain
- `GET /` - List domains (with optional include_deleted)
- `GET /{domain_id}` - Get domain by ID
- `PUT /{domain_id}` - Update domain
- `DELETE /{domain_id}` - Soft delete domain
- `POST /{domain_id}/restore` - Restore domain

### Categories (`/api/v1/categories`)
- `POST /` - Create category
- `GET /` - List all categories (with optional include_deleted)
- `GET /domain/{domain_id}` - List categories by domain
- `GET /{category_id}` - Get category by ID
- `PUT /{category_id}` - Update category
- `DELETE /{category_id}` - Soft delete category
- `POST /{category_id}/restore` - Restore category

### Assets (`/api/v1/assets`)
- `POST /` - Create asset
- `GET /` - List assets (with optional domain_id, category_id, include_deleted filters)
- `GET /{asset_id}` - Get asset by ID
- `PUT /{asset_id}` - Update asset
- `DELETE /{asset_id}` - Soft delete asset
- `POST /{asset_id}/restore` - Restore asset

### Admin Endpoints
Similar endpoints under `/admin/v1/*` with admin defaults (include_deleted=true by default)

## Data Model Features

### Timestamps
All entities include:
```python
created_at: datetime | None = None
updated_at: datetime | None = None  
deleted_at: datetime | None = None
```

### Soft Delete Methods
All entities support:
```python
def is_deleted() -> bool
def soft_delete()
def restore()
def update()
```

## Validation Features
- Duplicate checking for unique fields (usernames, domain names, category names within domains)
- Proper error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes
- Entity not found validation
- Restore validation (can't restore non-deleted entities)

## Technical Improvements
- Fixed deprecation warnings by using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`
- Maintained constructor-based dependency injection pattern
- Preserved vector database integration for assets

## Test Coverage
- 29 comprehensive tests covering all CRUD operations
- Test scenarios include:
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Soft delete and restore functionality
  - Validation and error cases
  - Duplicate prevention
  - Filtering capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Managing Users
```python
# Create user
user = await user_service.create_user("john_doe", Role.USER)

# Update user
updated = await user_service.update_user(user.id, username="john_updated", role=Role.DOMAIN_ADMIN)

# Soft delete user
await user_service.delete_user(user.id)

# List users (excludes deleted)
users = await user_service.list_users()

# List all users (includes deleted)
all_users = await user_service.list_users(include_deleted=True)

# Restore user
restored = await user_service.restore_user(user.id)
```

### Asset Management with Filtering
```python
# List assets by domain
domain_assets = await asset_service.list_assets(domain_id=domain_id)

# List assets by category
category_assets = await asset_service.list_assets(category_id=category_id)

# List all assets including deleted
all_assets = await asset_service.list_assets(include_deleted=True)
```

## Security Considerations
- No hard deletes ensure data preservation
- Admin endpoints provide access to deleted entities for data recovery
- Proper validation prevents unauthorized operations

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready CRUD system with comprehensive soft delete support and maintains data integrity throughout all operations.
